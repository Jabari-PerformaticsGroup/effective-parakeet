Abstract:

Vision by @polevaultdream: 
Global citizens will want to be able to obtain bitcoin without having to interact with the legacy financial system. This can be accomplished by using a gift card system to provide bitcoin directly to consumer via point of sale devices, and collecting fund from the user via several methods (cash, debit card, credit card, bank transfer, mobile apps such as CashApp, Zelle, and PayPal). 

Vision by @abitcoinperson:
US residents will want to obtain bitcoin without having to provide the legacy financial system with unnecessary personal information. This can be accomplished by accepting bitcoin directy from a re-seller, and then providing vouchers to the reseller on demand so they can resell to their customers. [need more info]
